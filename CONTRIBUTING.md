# protocol

0. don't ask for more help than this. at least, not impolitely.
1. releases go in the #catalog div in index.html. links should display only
   the number, and might show more info in a tooltip.
2. don't vandalize/modify previous items, unless you want to annotate them.
   annotations in links and text can be displayed, in other item types (like
   releases) they should be kept in html comments (`<!-- -->`).
